How can we help people with language help more effectively?			

Be-my-translator is an app/web application where people who want to help other people can add their own profile and their language skills. Then the people who want help can enter the app and either choose to use the camera to take a picture, but also by entering text or voice and then the people who has these languages in their profile will then get a notification that a user wants help with translating something. Think of it as stackoverflow, but for people who wants stuff translated. :)
